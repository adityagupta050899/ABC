Introduction The purpose of the Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) is to report known or suspected violations of law or suspicious activity observed by financial institutions subject to the regulations of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA).  In many instances, SARs have been instrumental in enabling law enforcement to initiate or supplement major money laundering or terrorist financing investigations and other criminal cases.  Information provided in SAR forms also presents the Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) with a method of identifying emerging trends and patterns associated with financial crimes. The information about those trends and patterns is vital to law enforcement agencies and provides valuable feedback to financial institutions. 

Financial institutions are required to submit SAR forms that are complete, sufficient and timely filed.  Unfortunately, some financial institutions file SAR forms that contain incomplete, incorrect, and/or disorganized narratives, making further analysis difficult, if not impossible.  Some SAR forms are submitted with blank narratives.  The failure to adequately describe the factors making the transaction or activity suspicious undermines the very purpose of the SAR and lessens its usefulness to law enforcement.  Because the SAR narrative serves as the only free text area for summarizing suspicious activity, it is essential that financial institutions’ staff write narratives that are clear, concise, and thorough.

Also, late filings, absence of supplementary SARs, and/or inaccuracies in SARs have an impact upon law enforcement’s ability to determine whether a crime was committed or continues to be committed, and the extent of any possible criminal activity that has been committed.  Therefore, it is imperative that financial institutions not only file complete and sufficient SARs but that those SARs are filed within the established deadlines.

Many different financial industries are now required to file SARs.  Each SAR form was specifically designed to accommodate respective institution types [e.g., depository institutions, money services businesses (MSBs), securities sector, etc.].  Despite the fact that these industries use different SAR formats, the basic structure for a SAR narrative remains the same.  The purpose of Guidance on Preparing A Complete & Sufficient Suspicious Activity Report Narrativeis to educate SAR filers on how to organize and write narrative details that maximizes the value of each SAR form by:

- using a simple methodology for evaluating and reporting information for the SAR narrative and why it is important;

- providing a general guideline on how to organize the SAR narrative so that critical details are concise and follow a logical order of presentation; and 

- providing respective industries with examples of sufficient and insufficient SAR narratives.

Information presented in this guidance document should be used in conjunction with the instructions provided with the appropriate SAR forms, guidance provided in other FinCEN publications (such as The SAR ActivityReview – Trends, Tips & Issues,FinCEN Advisory Issue 33: Informal Value Transfer Systems), and respective industry advisories from the federal regulatory authorities.  The information in Guidance on Preparing A Complete & Sufficient Suspicious Activity Report Narrative is provided solely to assist respective financial institutions in strengthening existing due diligence initiatives and anti-money laundering programs.
