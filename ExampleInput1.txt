ALERT NARRATIVE

Alert #: A-1 Create Date: 9/30/2024


Focal Entity: John Diamond

CIN: C-1

Review Scope: 9/2/2024 – 9/14/2024


Determination / Rationale:

Based on a review of internal and external sources, the reviewed transactions appear to potential suspicious.

Cash Structuring $10k

Rapid Movements of Funds

Large Wire to High Risk Jurisdiction

The customer made 12 cash deposits for $9,000.00 each, totaling $108,000.00 over the course of 12 consecutive days between 9/2/2024 and 9/13/2024. According to KYC information, the customer is employed in the manufacturing industry, which is not a cash-intensive business and investigation of internal and external sources did not identify a legitimate source of funds for these cash deposits. On 9/14/2024, the customer then sent a wire transfer for $105,000.000 to ACME Investment Management in the Cayman Islands. The customer’s KYC information does not indicate any apparent connection between either ACME Investment Management or the Cayman Islands.


A SAR filing is recommended for the following reasons:

The customer apparently made 12 structured cash deposits for $9,000 each over 12 consecutive days without a legitimate source of funds.

Shortly after make the cash deposits, the customer initiated a wire transfer to an unrelated company with which the customer has no apparent connection.

There is no apparent lawful economic purpose for the customer’s activity.

The involvement of the high risk jurisdiction of the Cayman Islands.
